# Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a python library used for plotting the data. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using GUI toolkits. It is designed such that it resembles closely to MATLAB (Matrix Laboratory), which at the time was the most popular programming language in Academia. 

A distinguishing feature of Matplotlib is the Pyplot state machine. This feature enables the user to write concise procedural code. In practice, using Matplotlib wihtout Pyplot is not the best option the represent the data. 

It is also worth noting that since the team could not get the xml-validation in the API to be working in the remaining given time, the visualization then is only processing the data by the means of JSON endpoints

## Why Matplotlib?
Matplotlib was first released when Python as getting popularity among programmers which helped Matplotlib gain popularity among big data analysist programmers. Matplotlib provides a very user-friendly environment to the programmers and non-IT users alike. For the programmers, it provides them readability when looking at the writer's source of code. And for the users 

There are a lot of libraries that can be installed for visualization in data analysis like Seaborn, Ggplot, Bokeh, Geoplotlib, etc. Seaborn is one of very powerful libraries which is used to create beatuiful charts ina few lines of code. But one thing to note of is that Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib to tweak Seaborn's default. So having good knowledge in Matplotlib will help the user to use the complicated and famous libraries also.  

## Data
The data that the user will get from this visualization is the collection of users along with how many quotes, notes, events and sessions are associated with each user. One user can have multiple quotes with zero notes, and the same goes with the other two entries. 

## Graph type
The graphs that will be displayed by using Matplotlib are bar chart and pie chart
